control_category: Resilience and Continuity Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union maintains a documented, tested, and effective Business Continuity
  and Disaster Recovery (BC/DR) program that enables timely recovery of critical operations,
  systems, and member services following disruptions, including cyber incidents, natural
  disasters, and third-party failures.

description: >
  This module assesses the institution's resilience plans, focusing on the ability to sustain
  critical business functions, recover technology systems, and meet defined recovery time
  objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs) in a trusted state.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive and tested Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery program that identifies critical operations via a BIA, defines recovery objectives (RTO/RPO), and supports timely restoration of systems and services following disruptions. The program is periodically tested, aligned with the IRP, and corrective actions are tracked, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748 and Appendix B to Part 749.
  partial: >
    A BC/DR program exists, but lacks consistent maturity. While a plan and BIA are documented, testing may be infrequent, lack realistic scope (e.g., only tabletop exercises), or the tracking of corrective actions from test gaps is deficient. Third-party dependencies may also be inconsistently addressed.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery program is incomplete or inadequately implemented. Deficiencies were identified in planning, the BIA, recovery strategies, or testing, limiting the institution’s ability to recover from disruptions and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748 and Appendix B to Part 749.
