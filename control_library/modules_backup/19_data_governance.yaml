regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Sections III(A), III(B), III(C)(1)"

control_category: Data Governance and Data Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union establishes, documents, and maintains a comprehensive data governance framework
  that governs the full lifecycle of member and institutional data, including inventory, classification, access,
  retention, protection, analytics use, and oversight, to safeguard member information and meet regulatory expectations.

description: >
  This module assesses the formal program governing the organization's data assets, focusing on defined ownership,
  accurate inventory management, strong data protection measures (like encryption and masking), and formal
  oversight by management.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive data governance program supported by a formally approved policy, a complete data inventory that is annually reconciled, strong access and encryption controls, and active oversight. Data Owner and Data Steward roles are segregated, and KPIs are measured and reported, effectively safeguarding member information in accordance with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    Data governance controls exist but are incomplete or inconsistently applied. This may include an outdated or incomplete data inventory, lack of formal annual reconciliation, inconsistent enforcement of retention/disposal requirements, or absence of KPI measurement/reporting to management.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s data governance practices are materially deficient. Deficiencies were identified in policy approval, data inventory creation/reconciliation, access controls, encryption, retention, or oversight, significantly increasing risk to member information and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
