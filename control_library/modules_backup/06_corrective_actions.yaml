title: Corrective Actions and Issue Management
section_name: Corrective Actions (Issue Tracking, Exceptions, and Remediation)
regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Sections III(B)(3)(b)–(f)"

control_category: Corrective Action Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union maintains a formal, documented, and consistently implemented
  process to track, manage, and resolve identified issues, exceptions, and corrective
  actions in a timely manner, with appropriate oversight, reporting, and integration
  into the risk assessment process.

description: >
  This module assesses the process for managing findings from audits, testing, and risk
  assessments, ensuring issues are owned, remediated, and revalidated, thereby closing
  the security feedback loop.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a formal and effective process for tracking, managing, and resolving identified issues, exceptions, and corrective actions. Issues are documented in a centralized system, reported to management and the Board, and integrated into the risk assessment process to ensure residual risk is properly accepted, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748 requirements.
  partial: >
    A corrective action process exists, but implementation is inconsistent. Issues are tracked but lack complete detail (e.g., missing ownership or target dates), or reporting to the Board is sporadic. The primary weakness is the inconsistent or missing linkage of open/accepted issues back to the formal risk assessment.
  negative: >
    The institution lacks a consistent and effective process for tracking and resolving identified issues, exceptions, and corrective actions. Issues are not reliably documented, tracked to resolution, or integrated into the risk assessment process, resulting in insufficient oversight and non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
