finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The Information Security Program (ISP) demonstrates strong administrative governance. The Board
    formally approves the ISP, roles are clearly assigned, policies are up-to-date and comprehensive,
    and the program is regularly adjusted to address new risks and threats.
  partial: >
    Core governance structures are in place, but consistency is lacking. While the ISP is approved,
    documentation (e.g., training records, policy revision histories) is inconsistent, or program
    adjustments lag behind emerging threats, requiring targeted remediation actions.
  negative: >
    The ISP lacks formal Board approval, key security roles are ambiguous, or policies are severely
    outdated and incomplete, reflecting insufficient governance and oversight and posing a
    significant risk to the institution's security posture.
