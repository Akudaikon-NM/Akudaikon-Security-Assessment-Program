control_category: Application and System Development
control_objective: >
  Ensure all internally developed or customized software is built, tested, and deployed securely
  through a formal, documented development lifecycle that incorporates security, quality assurance,
  and change management controls.

description: >
  This control requires a formal SDLC policy defining mandatory security requirements, segregation
  of duties, integrated security testing (SAST/DAST/Penetration Testing), strict vulnerability
  remediation, and formal release gating controls enforced by the enterprise Change Management
  process.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a mature and secure SDLC supported by a formal policy, segregation of duties, comprehensive security testing (SAST/DAST/Pen-Testing), and effective vulnerability management. Mandatory security release gates (SDLC-06) and explicit integration with Change Management ensure that only approved and secure code is deployed to production in accordance with Appendix A requirements.
  partial: >
    The SDLC exists but security controls are inconsistently applied. Deficiencies may include ad-hoc security testing, inconsistent remediation of vulnerabilities, or lack of formal enforcement of security release gates (SDLC-06), increasing the risk of application security issues reaching production.
  negative: >
    The SDLC is ineffective or incomplete. Material deficiencies were identified in policy, segregation of duties, mandatory security testing, or release governance. The lack of enforced security release gates (SDLC-06) or security reviews for high-risk systems (SDLC-07) leads to unmitigated application security risks and results in non-compliance with Appendix A requirements.
