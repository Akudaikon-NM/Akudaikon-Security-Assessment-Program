title: Anti-Malware and Endpoint Protection Controls
section_name: Antivirus and Antimalware Controls
regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Sections III(A), III(B), III(C)(1)"

control_category: System and Information Integrity
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union deploys and maintains effective antivirus and antimalware
  controls across all applicable endpoints and systems to detect, prevent, and remediate
  malicious code, supporting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of member
  information.

description: >
  This module assesses the completeness, configuration, and monitoring of technical
  controls designed to protect systems (endpoints and servers) from malicious software,
  including traditional viruses, modern malware, and ransomware.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution has implemented comprehensive, centrally managed endpoint protection controls (EDR/XDR) across all applicable systems. These controls feature real-time scanning, automatic updates, and logging of detection events, which are monitored and effectively integrated with the Incident Response Program and risk management processes, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    Antimalware controls exist, but deficiencies were found in coverage (e.g., gaps on non-Windows systems), configuration (e.g., reliance on signature-only scanning), or centralized management/monitoring. This reduces the institution's ability to detect and respond to advanced or file-less malicious code.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s antivirus and antimalware controls are incomplete or inconsistently implemented. Significant coverage gaps, lack of centralized management, or insufficient monitoring were identified, materially limiting the ability to detect and respond to malicious code and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
