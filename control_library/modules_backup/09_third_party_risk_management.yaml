finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive, risk-based third-party risk management program that includes board-approved policies, documented due diligence, robust contractual safeguards, ongoing monitoring (including SOC reports), and regular board reporting. These practices demonstrate effective oversight of vendor risks and compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    A third-party risk management program exists, but lacks consistent execution in one or more areas. Deficiencies were identified in periodic due diligence reviews, contractual safeguards are sometimes incomplete, or ongoing monitoring of non-critical vendors is sporadic.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s third-party risk management program is incomplete or inconsistently implemented. Deficiencies were identified in vendor due diligence, contractual safeguards, monitoring, or board oversight, limiting the institution’s ability to manage third-party risks and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
