finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution has implemented layered network security controls, including firewalls configured for least access, active intrusion detection/prevention, robust network segmentation, and continuous log monitoring. Network configurations are documented and aligned with secure standards, supporting the protection of member information in accordance with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    Network security controls exist, but weaknesses were identified. This may include firewall rule sets that are overly permissive, insufficient segmentation between critical and non-critical assets, or inconsistent monitoring and alerting of network logs. Wireless security may rely on older, less secure protocols (e.g., WPA2-PSK).
  negative: >
    The credit union’s network security controls are materially deficient. Deficiencies were identified in perimeter defenses, segmentation (e.g., flat network), monitoring, or secure configurations, creating an elevated risk of unauthorized access and system compromise, resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
