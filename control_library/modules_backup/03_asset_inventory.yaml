control_category: Asset Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union maintains a complete, accurate, and current inventory of
  information assets, including systems, devices, applications, data repositories, and
  connections, to support effective risk assessment, protection of member information,
  and regulatory compliance.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of information assets that identifies systems, applications, devices, and data repositories supporting member information. The inventory defines ownership and criticality and is actively used to inform the information security risk assessment, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    An asset inventory exists, but completeness, accuracy, or utility are inconsistent. Gaps were noted in either identifying all assets, accurately documenting data classification (member information), or ensuring timely updates, which moderately impedes effective risk assessment.
  negative: >
    The institution does not maintain a complete or current inventory of information assets, and assets that store, process, or transmit member information are not clearly identified. This fundamentally limits effective risk assessment and protection of member information and results in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
