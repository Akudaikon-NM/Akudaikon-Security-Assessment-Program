finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution demonstrates effective governance by providing the Board of Directors with a comprehensive annual Information Security Program report that includes risk assessment results, control testing outcomes, security incidents, third-party oversight, and mitigation activities, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748 requirements.
  partial: >
    The annual report to the Board exists but is partially effective. Core elements like general risk summary and policy updates are present, but crucial details such as complete control testing outcomes, summary of third-party risk, or documentation of risk acceptance decisions are insufficient or missing, limiting the Board’s ability to exercise full oversight.
  negative: >
    The annual report to the Board of Directors does not include all required regulatory elements of the Information Security Program, such as complete risk assessment results, key control testing outcomes, or security incident summaries, significantly limiting the Board’s ability to exercise effective cybersecurity oversight and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
