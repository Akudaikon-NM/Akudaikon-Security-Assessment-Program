title: Information Security Baseline Controls (Core Technical Checklist)
section_name: Foundational Cybersecurity Controls
regulatory_anchor: "12 CFR 748.0; Appendix A to Part 748 (Sections III(C), III(E)); FFIEC IT Examination Handbook – Information Security; NIST Cybersecurity Framework"

control_category: Core Technical Security
control_objective: >
  Ensure core technical controls are implemented consistently across the environment to establish
  a minimum security baseline that protects critical systems and member data from common attack
  vectors, particularly focusing on access, data integrity, and real-time detection.

description: >
  This control validates the operational effectiveness of high-priority security functions, including
  mandatory multi-factor authentication (MFA) for privileged and remote access, immutable and
  segregated backups to defend against ransomware, ubiquitous deployment of Endpoint Detection
  and Response (EDR), and mandatory encryption for sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

key_entities:
  - Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) System
  - Backup and Recovery Infrastructure
  - Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) Solution
  - Encryption Key Management
  - Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a strong Information Security Baseline, with critical technical controls (MFA, immutable backups, EDR) consistently enforced across the environment. Configuration management and data protection standards meet or exceed regulatory expectations, demonstrating a robust defense against modern attack vectors.
  partial: >
    The institution has implemented core security controls, but enforcement is inconsistent. Deficiencies were noted in the scope of MFA enforcement (SBC-24-01), lack of immutability for critical backups (SBC-24-02), or incomplete EDR deployment, leaving portions of the environment vulnerable to common attack methods.
  negative: >
    The Information Security Baseline is severely deficient. Critical controls such as MFA, immutable backups, or EDR are missing or ineffective. This failure to implement foundational safeguards creates high-risk exposure to data loss, unauthorized access, and non-compliance with FFIEC and NCUA security requirements.
