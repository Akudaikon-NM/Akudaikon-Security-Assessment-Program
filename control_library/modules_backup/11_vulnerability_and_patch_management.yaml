title: Vulnerability and Patch Management
section_name: Vulnerability and Patch Management
regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Sections III(A), III(B), III(C)(1)"

control_category: System and Information Integrity
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union maintains a formal, risk-based vulnerability and patch management
  program to identify, prioritize, remediate, and verify remediation of security vulnerabilities
  in a timely manner to protect member information and critical systems.

description: >
  This module assesses the effectiveness of the process used to proactively identify,
  analyze, and mitigate security flaws (vulnerabilities) in software, operating systems,
  and hardware, ensuring that patches and updates are applied promptly according to risk.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a formal and risk-based vulnerability and patch management program that includes regular automated scanning, prioritized remediation based on risk, timely patch deployment, and effective management oversight. Results are documented, exceptions are formally approved, and the overall posture is integrated into the information security risk assessment, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    A vulnerability and patch management program exists, but execution is inconsistent. While scanning is performed, remediation timelines for high or medium vulnerabilities are routinely missed, or the formal documentation for exceptions and compensating controls is lacking.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s vulnerability and patch management program is incomplete or inconsistently implemented. Automated scanning is not performed or is inadequate, and vulnerabilities are not identified, prioritized, or remediated in a timely manner. This severely increases the risk of exploitation and results in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
