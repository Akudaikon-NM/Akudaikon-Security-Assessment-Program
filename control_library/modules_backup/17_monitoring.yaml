finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution demonstrates effective security monitoring by implementing documented policies, centralized logging and SIEM capabilities, and continuous monitoring of network, system, and user activity. Alerts are generated, tuned, reviewed, and supported by formal testing and management reporting, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    Security monitoring controls exist but are incomplete or lack rigor. This may include missing log sources for critical systems, lack of consistent alert tuning leading to alert fatigue, or the absence of a formal process to validate monitoring effectiveness (e.g., no red team/attack simulation testing).
  negative: >
    The credit union’s security monitoring program is materially deficient. Deficiencies were noted in centralized logging, alerting, or coverage of critical systems and networks, severely limiting the ability to detect and respond to anomalous activity and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
