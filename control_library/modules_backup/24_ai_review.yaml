regulatory_anchor: "12 CFR 748.0; 12 CFR 748.1; Appendix A to Part 748 (Sections II, III(A)–III(E)); Appendix B to Part 748; GLBA (12 CFR Part 1016); Regulation B (12 CFR Part 1002)"

control_category: Emerging Technology Governance
control_objective: >
  Ensure the institution establishes a comprehensive governance, risk management, and compliance
  framework for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) that safeguards member information, ensures
  ethical and explainable outcomes, complies with applicable regulations, and maintains effective board
  and management oversight.

description: >
  This control requires a formal AI governance framework defining acceptable use, risk assessment,
  oversight, model validation, and continuous monitoring throughout the AI lifecycle. It focuses on
  mitigating specific risks related to data privacy, cybersecurity, bias, and regulatory compliance,
  especially regarding fair lending (Regulation B).

  - AI Usage Policy and Framework
  - AI Risk Assessment
  - AI Oversight Committee / Governance Structure
  - AI Models and Validation Reports

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution demonstrates a comprehensive AI governance and compliance framework by maintaining formal policies (AI-01), specific risk assessments (AI-03), robust data and cybersecurity controls (AI-05/08), and transparent, validated models (AI-07). Active board oversight and inclusion in compliance audits (AI-09) ensure responsible and compliant AI use, aligning with 12 CFR Part 748 and related regulatory expectations.
  partial: >
    An AI governance framework is emerging, but security or compliance controls are incomplete. Deficiencies may include a lack of formal model validation (AI-07), inconsistent monitoring for bias and drift, or a failure to formally integrate AI risks into the enterprise risk assessment (AI-03), potentially increasing regulatory and operational risks.
  negative: >
    The institution lacks a formal AI governance framework. Significant weaknesses were identified in policy development (AI-01), risk assessment (AI-03), and model oversight (AI-07), leaving AI systems and the data they use exposed to unmitigated regulatory risks (e.g., fair lending, data privacy) and resulting in non-compliance with 12 CFR Part 748.
