regulatory_anchor: "FFIEC IT Examination Handbook (Outsourcing Technology Services); Bank Service Company Act (BSCA), 12 U.S.C. §§ 1861-1867; NCUA Letter 07-CU-13; NCUA Supervisory Letter 17-CU-09"

control_category: Third-Party Risk Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure the institution performs comprehensive and risk-based due diligence on all prospective
  third-party vendors and partners to assess financial stability, legal compliance, security controls,
  strategic alignment, and establish appropriate contractual safeguards prior to engagement.

description: >
  This control requires the pre-contractual due diligence phase to include formal vendor risk
  assessment, cost-benefit analysis, evaluation of financial and legal history, selection consideration
  of multiple vendors, and the establishment of robust contractual terms (SLAs, right-to-audit).
  Special attention is required for vendors handling sensitive data or utilizing emerging technologies,
  such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) components.

key_entities:
  - Vendor Risk Assessment
  - Cost-Benefit Analysis Documentation
  - Vendor Selection Records (RFP/RFI)
  - Legal/Compliance Review
  - Executed Contract/Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a mature and proactive third-party due diligence process. All relationships are initiated only after a documented, risk-based assessment (TP-23-01), cost-benefit analysis, and formal approval. Contracts contain strong, enforceable safeguards (TP-23-05), demonstrating strong control over third-party risk exposure in compliance with NCUA and FFIEC guidance.
  partial: >
    A due diligence process exists, but it is inconsistent or incomplete. Deficiencies may include a lack of formal documentation for risk assessment (TP-23-01) or cost-benefit analysis (TP-23-02), or contracts may be missing key security or right-to-audit clauses (TP-23-05), increasing inherent risk before the relationship even begins.
  negative: >
    Third-party due diligence is non-existent or materially ineffective. Vendors are engaged without formal risk assessment or contractual safeguards, leading to unmitigated financial, operational, and security risks. This results in non-compliance with regulatory expectations for oversight and vendor management.
