finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive information security training and awareness program that provides regular, role-appropriate training to employees, Board members, and officials. Training content addresses current threats, incident response, and security best practices, and participation is fully documented and reported in accordance with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    A training program exists, but compliance is inconsistent. Gaps were noted in training content (e.g., missing specific coverage of current threats or incident response), or there are significant gaps in documented attendance, particularly for Board members or specific business units.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s information security training and awareness program is incomplete or inconsistently implemented. Training does not adequately cover required topics, participation is not fully documented, or Board and official training is lacking, resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748 and leaving personnel unprepared for cyber threats.
