section_name: Controls Testing (Independent Testing and Validation)
regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Sections III(A), III(B), III(C)"

control_category: Security Control Assurance
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union conducts regular, independent testing of administrative, technical,
  and physical information security controls to verify effectiveness, identify weaknesses,
  and ensure timely remediation in order to safeguard member information.

description: >
  This module assesses the formal program for validating control effectiveness, including
  the independence, scope, frequency, reporting, and issue management process for all
  testing activities.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive and risk-based independent testing program that includes regular audits, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing. Testing results are documented, formally reported to management and the Board, and corrective actions are tracked, prioritized, and revalidated, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748 requirements.
  partial: >
    Independent testing is performed, but gaps exist in its execution or follow-up. Testing may be ad hoc or the scope is not fully risk-based. The primary weakness noted is inconsistent tracking, prioritization, or revalidation of identified issues, which leaves residual risk unconfirmed.
  negative: >
    The institution does not maintain a formal or consistently executed independent testing program for information security controls. Testing activities are ad hoc or incomplete, remediation is not consistently tracked, and results are not adequately reported to management or the Board, resulting in a fundamental lack of assurance and non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
