regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Section III.B; Section III.C(1)"

control_category: Risk Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union conducts a documented, periodic information security risk
  assessment that identifies internal, external, and third-party risks to member
  information and informs the design and effectiveness of the Information Security Program.

description: >
  This module assesses the methodology, scope, and output of the risk assessment process,
  focusing on its use as the fundamental driver for security control implementation
  and prioritization.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution conducts a comprehensive and documented information security risk assessment that identifies internal, external, and third-party risks to member information. The results are actively and demonstrably used to inform and update the Information Security Program and prioritize controls, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748, Section III.B.
  partial: >
    A risk assessment exists, but its scope or execution is inconsistent. Gaps were noted in the treatment of third-party risk or the methodology for evaluating existing control effectiveness. While the ISP is generally aligned, prioritization of controls is not fully driven by measurable risk reduction.
  negative: >
    The institution does not maintain a complete or current information security risk assessment, and risks to member information from internal, external, or third-party sources are not adequately identified or evaluated. This renders the Information Security Program ineffective and results in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748, Section III.B.
