  to prevent unauthorized disclosure, exfiltration, or misuse of member information
  across endpoints, networks, email, and cloud services.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution has implemented a comprehensive data leak protection program that includes formal data classification, technical prevention controls across high-risk channels (email, endpoint, web), and continuous monitoring of data transfers. DLP alerts are logged, investigated, and the program is integrated with incident response and risk management processes, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    DLP controls exist but coverage or effectiveness is inconsistent. This may include reliance on email-only DLP without endpoint or cloud coverage, or the absence of a formal data classification effort to accurately define and tag sensitive data. Monitoring may be inconsistent, leading to delayed incident response.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s data leak protection controls are materially deficient. Sensitive data is not adequately classified or monitored, and technical controls or oversight are insufficient, creating a high risk of unauthorized data disclosure and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
