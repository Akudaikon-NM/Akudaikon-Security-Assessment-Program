control_category: Access Control
control_objective: >
  Ensure the credit union implements effective access control mechanisms to restrict
  access to information systems and sensitive member information based on job
  responsibilities, enforce least privilege, and prevent unauthorized access, misuse,
  or data exposure.

description: >
  This module assesses the administrative and technical controls governing who
  can access what resources, focusing on the principles of least privilege, need-to-know,
  strong authentication, and privileged access management (PAM).

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a comprehensive access control program that enforces least privilege, role-based access, and strong authentication controls, including MFA for privileged access. Access rights are reviewed periodically, privileged accounts are appropriately restricted and monitored, and activities are logged in accordance with Appendix A to Part 748.
  partial: >
    Access controls exist, but weaknesses were identified in one or more areas. This may include inconsistent enforcement of least privilege, sporadic access review (recertification) frequency, or a lack of MFA/PAM for certain privileged accounts.
  negative: >
    The credit union’s access control practices are incomplete or inconsistently implemented. Deficiencies were identified in access provisioning, privileged account management, periodic reviews, or monitoring, resulting in increased risk of unauthorized access and non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
