section_name: Change and Configuration Management
regulatory_anchor: "12 CFR 748.0; Appendix A III(C)(2), III(D)"

control_category: Change Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure that all changes to information systems are formally authorized, tested, documented,
  and implemented in a controlled manner to reduce the risk of unauthorized changes,
  system outages, or security vulnerabilities, and that configurations are securely maintained.

description: >
  This module assesses the formal process for managing changes to the credit union's information
  systems and the establishment and maintenance of secure configuration baselines for all critical assets.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution demonstrates effective change and configuration management by maintaining documented policies and procedures that ensure all system changes are formally authorized, tested, and monitored prior to implementation, consistent with Appendix A requirements. Roles are segregated, rollback plans are documented, and configuration baselines are regularly validated against unauthorized modifications.
  partial: >
    Change and configuration management controls exist, but consistency or scope is lacking. This may include inconsistent evidence of testing or rollback plans for non-critical changes, or baseline validation that is sporadic or manual, leading to a risk of undetected configuration drift.
  negative: >
    The credit union lacks effective change and configuration management controls. System changes are not consistently documented, approved, or tested, and/or configuration baselines are non-existent or ignored. This results in a high risk of unauthorized or insecure modifications, constituting non-compliance with Appendix A requirements.
