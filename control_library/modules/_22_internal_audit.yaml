control_category: Independent Assurance and Oversight
control_objective: >
  Ensure the institution maintains an independent, risk-based internal audit program that provides
  ongoing assurance over information security, technology, and operational controls, with timely
  reporting, follow-up, and board oversight.

description: >
  The internal audit function must be independent, governed by a formal charter, and execute a
  risk-based audit plan approved by the Board or Audit Committee. The process requires documented
  work programs, formal reporting of findings with management responses, secure work paper
  retention, and a disciplined follow-up process to track all audit issues to resolution.

  - Internal Audit Charter
  - Risk-Based Audit Plan and Schedule
  - Board/Audit Committee

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains an independent, risk-based internal audit program supported by a formal audit charter, a Board-approved audit plan (IA-02), comprehensive work programs, and timely reporting. Audit findings are tracked through a disciplined follow-up process (IA-06) and reported to the Board, demonstrating strong governance and effective independent assurance over key risks.
  partial: >
    The internal audit program exists but has deficiencies in one or more core areas. Weaknesses may include inconsistent application of the risk-based planning methodology (IA-02), inadequate documentation of work programs, or an incomplete/inconsistent process for tracking audit findings to resolution (IA-06).
  negative: >
    The internal audit program is materially ineffective or lacking independence. Significant weaknesses were identified in audit planning (IA-02), reporting to the Board, or the formal follow-up process (IA-06), leading to unmitigated control failures and a failure to provide effective independent assurance.
