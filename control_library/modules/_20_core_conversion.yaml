control_category: System Development and Change Management
control_objective: >
  Ensure that core system conversions are managed through a formal project lifecycle that includes
  comprehensive planning, third-party oversight, testing, data assurance, training, and a robust
  contingency strategy to minimize operational, financial, and compliance risk.

description: >
  This control requires a formal project plan, governance structure, and oversight for all core system
  conversions. Critical elements include data integrity validation, comprehensive testing, vendor readiness
  assessment, a Go/No-Go decision gate, and a detailed conversion rollback strategy.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution demonstrates strong Core Conversion Management through a formal project lifecycle, comprehensive planning, testing, and vendor oversight. The conversion process includes the critical controls of formal data integrity validation (CCV-04), a Go/No-Go decision gate (CCV-05), and a documented rollback strategy (CCV-06), minimizing operational risk and ensuring data accuracy in alignment with Appendix A requirements.
  partial: >
    The Core Conversion Management process exists but lacks one or more critical control components. Deficiencies may include missing formal data integrity reconciliation, an undocumented Go/No-Go decision gate, or an untested/incomplete rollback strategy (CCV-04, CCV-05, or CCV-06), increasing operational risk.
  negative: >
    The core conversion management process is materially deficient. Critical controls for data assurance and contingency planning (CCV-04, CCV-05, CCV-06) were not implemented or documented, severely increasing operational and financial risk and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A requirements.
