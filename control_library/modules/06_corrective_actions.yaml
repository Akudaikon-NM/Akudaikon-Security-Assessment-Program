control_objective: "The scheduled test aims to assess the resilience of critical DNA\

  \ Solution\nFocus on Critical Systems:\nTesting DNA hosts ensures that the organization's\

  1.\nProactive Approach:\nScheduling an in-depth test demonstrates a commitment to\
  \ evaluating and improving the organization's BCP.o\n2.\nOpportunity for Improvement:\n\
  The test provides an opportunity to identify weaknesses in the current BCP and take\
  \ corrective actions based on findings.o\n3.\nWeaknesses of the Proposed Solution\n\
  Limited Scope:\nFocusing solely on DNA hosts may not address broader business continuity\
  \ risks, such as recovery times for non -DNA systems, communication protocols, or\
  \ employee preparedness.o\n1.\nDelayed Implementation:\nIf the test is not conducted\
  \ until October, the organization remains exposed to untested scenarios for several\
  \ months.o\n2.\nLack of Regular Testing:\nConducting a single in-depth test does\
  \ not meet the FFIEC guideline for regular testing of the BCP, which is typically\
  \ recommended at least annually or semi-annually.o\n3.\nAbsence of Comprehensive\

  Expand Scope:\nInclude additional critical systems beyond DNA hosts to ensure the\
  \ BCP is tested comprehensively.o\nSimulate real-world scenarios, such as ransomware\
  \ attacks or power outages, to evaluate preparedness.o\n1.\nEngage Key Stakeholders:\n\
  Involve representatives from all relevant departments to validate cross-functional\
  \ readiness.o\n2.\nLong-Term (Post-October):\nSchedule Regular Tests:\nEstablish\
