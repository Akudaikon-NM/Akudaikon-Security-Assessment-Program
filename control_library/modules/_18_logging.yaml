title: Security Logging and Audit Trail Management
section_name: Logging and Audit Trail Management
regulatory_anchor: "Appendix A to Part 748, Title 12, Sections III(A), III(B), III(C)(2)"

control_category: Security Monitoring and Logging
control_objective: >
  Ensure comprehensive security logging and audit trail management is implemented across all critical
  systems and applications to support security monitoring, incident investigation, and compliance
  with retention, integrity, and confidentiality requirements.

description: >
  This module assesses the completeness and security of the audit trail management program,
  ensuring logs are generated, securely stored, protected from tampering, retained for the minimum
  required period, and reviewed to support organizational security.

finding_templates:
  positive: >
    The institution maintains a formal, comprehensive logging program that ensures audit logs are generated on all critical systems, centrally stored with integrity controls (encryption/access control), retained for the required period (min. 90 days), and are actively monitored and reviewed, consistent with Appendix A to Part 748. Third-party vendor logs are also incorporated and monitored.
  partial: >
    Logging controls exist but are incomplete or inconsistently implemented. This may include missing logging from non-critical but relevant systems, inconsistent log retention periods, or a lack of formal log integrity controls, increasing the difficulty of incident investigation.
  negative: >
    The institution's logging and audit trail management is materially deficient. Critical systems lack proper audit logging, logs are not centrally or securely stored, or log retention periods (e.g., min 90 days) are not met, severely hindering incident investigation and resulting in non-compliance with Appendix A to Part 748.
