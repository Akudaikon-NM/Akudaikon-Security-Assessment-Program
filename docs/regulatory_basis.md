# Regulatory Basis for Evaluation

The Akudaikon 748 Assessor evaluates a credit union’s security program against enforceable regulatory requirements, with supporting guidance used strictly for interpretive alignment.

## Statutory Authority (GLBA)

Section 501(b) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) requires financial institutions to implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to:

- Protect the security and confidentiality of customer information
- Protect against anticipated threats or hazards
- Protect against unauthorized access or use that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience

GLBA establishes the legal obligation, but does not prescribe detailed implementation steps.

## Regulatory Implementation (§ 748.0)

For federally insured credit unions, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) implements GLBA’s safeguarding mandate through 12 CFR § 748.0 – Security Program.

Section § 748.0 translates GLBA’s high-level statutory requirements into specific, enforceable program obligations.

Under § 748.0, each federally insured credit union must develop and maintain a written security program designed to:

- Protect the confidentiality and security of member records and information
- Protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the integrity or security of those records
- Protect against unauthorized access or use that could result in substantial harm or serious inconvenience to a member
- Protect credit union offices from physical crimes, including robberies, burglaries, larcenies, and embezzlement
- Respond to incidents of unauthorized access to sensitive member information
- Prevent the destruction of vital records, as defined in 12 CFR Part 749
- Ensure proper disposal of consumer information, as required by § 748.0(c)

These requirements are mandatory and independently enforceable.

## Reporting and Notification (§ 748.1)

The assessment framework also evaluates compliance with 12 CFR § 748.1, including:

- Annual certification of compliance through the Credit Union Profile
- Catastrophic act reporting
- Cyber incident reporting within 72 hours
- Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) coordination, where applicable

## Role of Guidance (Former Appendices A & B)

Appendix A (Information Security Program Guidelines) and Appendix B (Response Programs and Member Notice Guidance) were issued to assist credit unions in meeting their statutory and regulatory obligations.

Although these appendices are now being repositioned as guidance rather than regulation, their substantive content remains highly relevant as an interpretive framework for:

- Program governance and oversight
- Risk assessment methodology
- Incident response structure
- Notification decision-making
- Board reporting expectations

In this assessment:

- Appendix-derived content is treated as supporting guidance
- Findings and ratings are anchored to GLBA and §§ 748.0 / 748.1
- No assessment conclusion relies on guidance alone

This ensures the evaluation remains valid regardless of how NCUA publishes or updates guidance in the future.

## Evaluation Methodology

Each assessment module evaluates whether the credit union can demonstrate, through documented evidence, that its security program:

- Meets the explicit requirements of § 748.0
- Is reasonably designed to satisfy GLBA’s safeguarding mandate
- Incorporates relevant NCUA guidance in a manner appropriate to the institution’s size, complexity, and risk profile

## Assessment Structure (per module)

Each evaluation section includes:

- Primary regulatory citation (GLBA, § 748.0, or § 748.1)
- Control objective (what must exist)
- Evaluation criteria (how adequacy is determined)
- Required evidence
- Examiner-style findings language
- Pass / Partial / Fail scoring
- Targeted remediation guidance
