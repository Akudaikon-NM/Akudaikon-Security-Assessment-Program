  The Scoring Calibration and Pilot LLM-Driven Assessment have conclusively 
  validated the structural integrity, scoring accuracy, and regulatory 
  defensibility of the enhanced, CFR-anchored control framework. The framework 
  demonstrates deterministic scoring, full traceability to enforceable regulations, 
  and effective cross-domain risk capture. The project objectives have been fully 
  achieved, and the framework is approved for production use.

  scoring_accuracy: Confirmed
  determinism: High – Quantitative failures translated directly into operating effectiveness scores
  traceability: End-to-end traceability from control failure to CFR citation confirmed
  cross_domain_risk_capture: Confirmed – Operational failures correctly escalated into governance findings
  automation_readiness: High – Examiner-grade findings produced without manual interpretation

  The control enhancement project is formally concluded. The YAML-based framework 
  is now the definitive, regulator-aligned, automation-ready system-of-record for 
  security program governance and incident reporting compliance. The organization 
  is positioned to support continuous, scalable, and examiner-defensible assessments 
  under 12 CFR §§ 748.0 and 748.1.
  
  All project objectives have been achieved:
  ✅ P1: Scoring calibration and LLM validation complete
  ✅ P2: Board reporting framework ready for deployment  
  ✅ P3: YAML framework formalized as authoritative system-of-record
  
  The framework demonstrates:
  • Strong regulatory defensibility (CFR-anchored)
  • High automation readiness (validated LLM assessments)
  • Operational efficiency (deterministic scoring)
  • Audit readiness (explicit evidence requirements)
  • Governance effectiveness (maturity-based scoring)
  
  Project Status: ✅ COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED
