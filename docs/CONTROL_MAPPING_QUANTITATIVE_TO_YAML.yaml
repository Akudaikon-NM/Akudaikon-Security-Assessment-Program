      Server hardening controls demonstrate Partially Effective performance

      interpretation: |
        Media encryption does NOT reduce frequency (lam_mult = 1.00) or loss 
        probability (p_any_mult = 1.00), but provides strong tail severity 
        reduction (tail_mult = 0.70) by rendering exfiltrated data unusable.

            Note: Despite strong tail reduction, overall combined score falls 
            in score 2 range due to no frequency/probability reduction.

      annual_cost: $20,000
      
      interpretation: |
        Error reduction (phishing/social engineering awareness) provides 
        modest frequency reduction (10%, lam_mult = 0.90) and loss probability 
        reduction (5%, p_any_mult = 0.95). No tail severity impact (tail_mult = 1.00) 
        as errors lead to varied consequences.

            Despite annual training program, effectiveness is limited. Human 
            error remains difficult to eliminate through training alone.
            
            Recommendation: Enhance with technical controls (email filtering, 
            browser isolation) to reduce lam_mult and p_any_mult further.

      Error Reduction controls (security awareness training) demonstrate 
      Ineffective performance (Operating Score 1) with limited frequency and 
      loss probability reduction. While annual training is conducted, human 
      error remains a persistent risk vector. Recommend enhancement with 
      technical controls including advanced email filtering, browser isolation, 
      and mandatory multi-factor authentication to compensate for human 
      limitations and achieve score 3-4.

      annual_cost: $40,000
      
      interpretation: |
        External monitoring (SIEM, threat detection) reduces frequency (15%, 
        lam_mult = 0.85) through early threat detection and deterrence, and 
        loss probability (15%, p_any_mult = 0.85) through rapid incident 
        containment. No tail severity impact (tail_mult = 1.00) as detection 
        timing varies.

          operating_effectiveness_derivation: |
            p_any_mult = 0.85 indicates moderate containment effectiveness.

      (15% each). While SIEM and threat detection capabilities exist, automated 
      response and advanced analytics are limited. Critically, this control 
      supports § 748.1 incident reporting readiness by reducing time-to-discovery. 
      Recommend enhancement with SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and

# OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS SCORING METHODOLOGY
# ============================================================================

operating_effectiveness_scoring:
  methodology: |
    Operating Effectiveness scores (1-5) are derived from combined control 
    multipliers using the following formula and thresholds:
    
    Combined Multiplier = (lam_mult × p_any_mult × tail_mult)^(1/3)
    
    Interpretation: Lower combined multiplier = stronger risk reduction
  
  scoring_thresholds:
    - score: 5
      label: Fully Effective
      combined_mult_range: "< 0.20"
      risk_reduction: "> 80%"
      interpretation: |
        Control provides comprehensive risk reduction across frequency, 
        probability, and severity dimensions. Exemplary performance.

      combined_mult_range: "0.20 - 0.40"
      risk_reduction: "60% - 80%"
      interpretation: |
        Control provides strong risk reduction with minor gaps. Performance 
        exceeds industry baseline.
      
      example_multipliers:
        - lam_mult: 0.30
          p_any_mult: 0.40

      label: Partially Effective
      combined_mult_range: "0.40 - 0.60"
      risk_reduction: "40% - 60%"
      interpretation: |
        Control provides moderate risk reduction. Performance meets minimum 
        § 748.0 expectations but requires improvement.
      
      example_multipliers:
        - lam_mult: 0.50

      risk_reduction: "20% - 40%"
      interpretation: |
        Control provides limited risk reduction. Execution gaps undermine 
        governance intent. Requires remediation.
      
      example_multipliers:
        - lam_mult: 0.75

      combined_mult_range: "> 0.80"
      risk_reduction: "< 20%"
      interpretation: |
        Control provides minimal or no measurable risk reduction. May exist 
        on paper but lacks operational effectiveness. Immediate remediation 
        required.
      
      example_multipliers:

        interpretation: Limited Effectiveness - enhance with automation
    
    overall_assessment: |
      Current control portfolio demonstrates LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS with all 
      controls scoring 1-2 (out of 5). While governance frameworks exist 
      (Design Effectiveness), technical execution lags best practice.
      
      Priority remediation actions:
      1. Enhance Error Reduction with technical controls (email filtering, MFA)
      2. Add DLP capabilities to Media Encryption
      3. Accelerate patch deployment for Server Hardening
      4. Implement SOAR for External Monitoring automation
      
      Target: 75% of controls scoring 4-5 by Q2 2026 to demonstrate § 748.0 
      Security Program effectiveness.

      yaml_module: 08_incident_response.yaml
      quantitative_controls:
        - External Monitoring (secondary)
      
      coverage_assessment: |
        Partially covered. Detection capabilities exist but response processes 
        require maturity enhancement.
      
      gaps:
        - Tabletop exercise frequency
        - Containment playbook automation

  uncovered_domains:
    - domain: Governance (GOV)
      yaml_module: 02_governance.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      rationale: |
        Governance is qualitative Design Effectiveness only. No quantitative 
        multipliers apply.
    
    - domain: Policies and Procedures (POL)
      yaml_module: 01_policies_and_procedures.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      rationale: |
        Policy framework is foundational governance. Operating Effectiveness 
        assessed through execution of referenced controls.
    
    - domain: Asset Inventory (AI)
      yaml_module: 03_asset_inventory.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      rationale: |
        Asset inventory enables other controls but does not directly reduce 
        risk. Consider adding control for "Asset Discovery and Tracking" 
        with lam_mult impact through attack surface reduction.
    
    - domain: Risk Assessment (RA)
      yaml_module: 04_risk_assessment.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      rationale: |
        Risk assessment informs control selection but is not itself a risk 
        reduction control.
    
    - domain: Third Party Risk Management (TPRM)
      yaml_module: 09_third_party_risk_management.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      recommendation: |
        Consider adding "Third Party Access Controls" with lam_mult and 
        p_any_mult impact based on vendor security requirements.
    
    - domain: Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery (BCDR)
      yaml_module: 10_business_continuity_disaster_recovery.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      recommendation: |
        Consider adding "Backup and Recovery" control with tail_mult impact 
        (reduces severity through data restoration capability).
    
    - domain: Access Controls (AC)
      yaml_module: 13_access_controls.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: Partial (key management for encryption)
      
      recommendation: |
        Consider adding "Privileged Access Management (PAM)" and "Multi-Factor 
        Authentication (MFA)" controls with strong lam_mult and p_any_mult impact.
    
    - domain: Network Security (NS)
      yaml_module: 14_network_security.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: Partial (email filtering for error reduction)
      
      recommendation: |
        Consider adding "Network Segmentation" and "Firewall Management" 
        controls with lam_mult and p_any_mult impact.
    
    - domain: AI Governance (AI)
      yaml_module: 23_ai_review.yaml
      quantitative_model_coverage: None
      
      recommendation: |
        Consider adding "AI Model Monitoring" control with p_any_mult impact 
        (detects model drift/poisoning before material loss).
