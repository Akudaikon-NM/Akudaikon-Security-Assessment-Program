final_project_validation: Scoring Calibration and Pilot LLM-Driven Assessment (P1)
authoritative_regulatory_anchor:
  - 12 CFR § 748.0 – Security Program
  - 12 CFR § 748.1 – Filing of Reports

validation_objective: |
  Validate that the enhanced, CFR-anchored control framework produces accurate, 
  consistent, and defensible scoring outcomes when applied to a high-impact 
  operational failure scenario, confirming readiness for production deployment.

validation_scenario:
  scenario_name: Failed Core Conversion and Audit Lag
  description: |
    A core system conversion experienced material operational issues related to 
    data integrity and rollback execution, followed by delayed audit escalation. 
    The scenario tests Core Conversion Management (CCV) and Internal Audit 
    Program (IA) controls under stress.
  
  material_events:
    - event: Data Integrity Failure
      details: |
        During cutover, 8% of account balances failed to reconcile due to a 
        data mapping error. Formal reconciliation documentation was not produced 
        until two weeks post-conversion.
    
    - event: Rollback Failure
      details: |
        Rollback was attempted using an outdated strategy, resulting in an 
        additional 48 hours of system downtime before full restoration.
    
    - event: Audit Escalation Lag
      details: |
        Internal Audit issued a High-Risk finding, but remediation was 60 days 
        overdue and escalation SLAs were insufficient to trigger immediate 
        Audit Committee notification.

assessment_results:
  - control_area: Core Conversion Management
    criterion_id: CCV-05
    criterion_name: Data Integrity Validation
    design_effectiveness_score: 3
    operating_effectiveness_score: 1
    risk_rating: High
    finding_summary: |
      Data reconciliation procedures existed but failed operationally, resulting 
      in a material data integrity failure affecting 8% of balances.
  
  - control_area: Core Conversion Management
    criterion_id: CCV-07
    criterion_name: Rollback Strategy
    design_effectiveness_score: 3
    operating_effectiveness_score: 1
    risk_rating: High
    finding_summary: |
      Rollback strategy documentation existed but was outdated and unusable, 
      leading to extended system downtime.
  
  - control_area: Internal Audit Program
    criterion_id: IA-11
    criterion_name: Escalation Timelines for High-Risk Findings
    design_effectiveness_score: 3
    operating_effectiveness_score: 2
    risk_rating: Medium
    finding_summary: |
      Audit issue escalation policy existed but lacked defined SLAs, resulting 
      in delayed Audit Committee awareness of a material, overdue high-risk issue.

llm_generated_findings:
  core_conversion_management:
    finding_type: Negative Finding – High Risk
    narrative: |
      The credit union's Core Conversion Management process was ineffective and 
      resulted in operational failure, violating the requirements of 12 CFR § 748.0 
      to maintain an effective security program. Material weaknesses were identified 
      in data integrity validation (CCV-05), resulting in reconciliation failures 
      affecting 8% of account balances. Additionally, the Conversion Rollback 
      Strategy (CCV-07) was outdated and unusable, causing extended system downtime 
      and elevating operational and reputational risk.
  
  internal_audit_program:
    finding_type: Governance Deficiency – Medium Risk
    narrative: |
      The Audit Issue Management process exhibited governance weaknesses. Formal 
      escalation timelines were not sufficiently defined or enforced to ensure 
      immediate Audit Committee notification of overdue high-risk findings. This 
      delayed governance awareness and limited the effectiveness of Board oversight 
      required under 12 CFR § 748.0.

validation_outcomes:
  determinism:
    status: Confirmed
    evidence: |
      Quantitative failures (8% reconciliation error, 60-day overdue remediation) 
      directly translated into low operating effectiveness scores.
  
  traceability:
    status: Confirmed
    evidence: |
      Findings are explicitly linked to CCV-05, CCV-07, and IA-11 and anchored 
      to 12 CFR § 748.0.
  
  maturity_based_scoring:
    status: Confirmed
    evidence: |
      Controls were penalized based on poor operating effectiveness despite 
      partial design maturity.
  
  cross_domain_risk_capture:
    status: Confirmed
    evidence: |
      The framework correctly identified and correlated failures across conversion 
      execution, data assurance, and governance oversight.

final_validation_conclusion: |
  The scoring calibration and pilot LLM-driven assessment successfully validate 
  the enhanced framework. The model produced accurate, consistent, and 
  regulator-defensible outcomes that reflect both control design and operating 
  effectiveness. The framework is fully validated and ready for operational 
  deployment.
