integration_title: Quantitative Risk Model to YAML Control Framework Integration
version: 1.0
effective_date: 2025-12-26

authoritative_regulatory_anchor:
  - 12 CFR § 748.0 – Security Program
  - 12 CFR § 748.1 – Filing of Reports

purpose: |
  Map quantitative cyber risk model outputs (Control Multipliers, VERIS fields, 
  CIS Controls, ATT&CK tactics, ROSI) to the qualitative, governance-focused 
  YAML control framework anchored to 12 CFR §§ 748.0 and 748.1, enabling 
  deterministic operating effectiveness scoring and board-level reporting.

# ============================================================================
# CORE INTEGRATION PRINCIPLE
# ============================================================================

core_integration_principle: |
  Technical risk reduction metrics directly inform the Operating Effectiveness 
  dimension of YAML control criteria, while qualitative governance structure 
  continues to inform Design Effectiveness.
  
  This dual-dimension approach ensures:
  • Design Effectiveness = Governance maturity (policies, procedures, oversight)
  • Operating Effectiveness = Technical performance (measurable risk reduction)
  
  Together, they provide a complete view of control maturity aligned to 
  12 CFR § 748.0 Security Program requirements.

  control_multipliers:
    description: |
      Control multipliers quantify the degree of risk reduction achieved by a 
      control across three dimensions: frequency, loss probability, and severity.
    
    multipliers:
      - field: lam_mult
        yaml_dimension: Operating Effectiveness – Frequency Reduction
        range: 0.0 to 1.0 (lower is better)
        interpretation: |
          Measures the degree to which a control reduces the likelihood of an 
          adverse event occurring. For example, strong change management reduces 
          the frequency of unauthorized system changes.
        yaml_usage: |
          Applied to Operating Effectiveness scoring for controls such as:
          • Change and Configuration Management (CCM)
          • Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
          • Monitoring and Detection
        example: |
          lam_mult = 0.30 indicates the control reduces event frequency by 70%
      
      - field: p_any_mult
        yaml_dimension: Operating Effectiveness – Loss Probability Reduction
        range: 0.0 to 1.0 (lower is better)
        interpretation: |
          Measures the degree to which a control reduces the probability that an 
          event results in loss. For example, detection before data exfiltration 
          reduces the probability of actual data loss.
        yaml_usage: |
          Applied to Operating Effectiveness scoring for controls such as:
          • Monitoring and Detection
          • Incident Response
          • Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
          • Access Controls
        example: |
          p_any_mult = 0.50 indicates 50% reduction in loss probability given 
          an event occurs
      
      - field: tail_mult
        yaml_dimension: Operating Effectiveness – Severity / Tail Risk Reduction
        range: 0.0 to 1.0 (lower is better)
        interpretation: |
          Measures the degree to which a control reduces worst-case loss magnitude 
          (Value at Risk - VaR, Conditional VaR - CVaR). Critical for controls 
          limiting catastrophic outcomes.
        yaml_usage: |
          Applied to Operating Effectiveness scoring for controls such as:
          • Data Governance (encryption, classification)
          • Backup and Recovery
          • Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery
          • Segmentation and Isolation
        example: |
          tail_mult = 0.20 indicates 80% reduction in worst-case loss severity
  
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Operating Effectiveness Scoring Thresholds
  # --------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  operating_effectiveness_scoring_thresholds:
    methodology: |
      Operating Effectiveness scores (1-5) are derived from combined control 
      multiplier performance. Combined multiplier is calculated as:
      
      combined_mult = (lam_mult × p_any_mult × tail_mult)^(1/3)
      
      This geometric mean ensures all three dimensions contribute to the final 
      effectiveness assessment.
    
    scoring_table:
      score_5:
        label: Fully Effective
        combined_multiplier: "< 0.20"
        risk_reduction: "80%+ reduction in modeled risk"
        interpretation: |
          Control demonstrates excellent performance across frequency, probability, 
          and severity reduction. Strong evidence of § 748.0 Security Program 
          effectiveness.
        
      score_4:
        label: Largely Effective
        combined_multiplier: "0.20 – 0.40"
        risk_reduction: "60-80% reduction in modeled risk"
        interpretation: |
          Control is effective but has minor gaps or inconsistencies in one 
          dimension. Generally meets § 748.0 expectations.
      
      score_3:
        label: Partially Effective
        combined_multiplier: "0.40 – 0.60"
        risk_reduction: "40-60% reduction in modeled risk"
        interpretation: |
          Control provides moderate risk reduction but shows material gaps in 
          execution, consistency, or coverage. Requires remediation to fully 
          support § 748.0 obligations.
      
      score_2:
        label: Limited Effectiveness
        combined_multiplier: "0.60 – 0.80"
        risk_reduction: "20-40% reduction in modeled risk"
        interpretation: |
          Control is in place but shows significant operational deficiencies. 
          May constitute a weakness under § 748.0.
      
      score_1:
        label: Ineffective
        combined_multiplier: "> 0.80"
        risk_reduction: "< 20% reduction in modeled risk"
        interpretation: |
          Control provides minimal or no measurable risk reduction. Likely 
          constitutes a material weakness requiring immediate remediation under 
          § 748.0.

  cis_controls:
    description: |
      CIS (Center for Internet Security) Controls define the technical scope and 
      best-practice implementation of security controls.
    
    yaml_usage: |
      CIS Controls are mapped to YAML control_objective_link values to:
      • Align technical implementation with industry best practices
      • Provide auditors with recognized control frameworks
      • Support remediation prioritization (CIS Implementation Groups)
      • Enable cross-framework reporting (NIST CSF, CIS, CFR)

  mitre_attack_tactics:
    description: |
      MITRE ATT&CK tactics describe adversary goals and techniques mitigated by 
      security controls.
    
    yaml_usage: |
      ATT&CK tactics provide:
      • Board-level threat context for control investments
      • Mapping to real-world threat actor behaviors
      • Demonstration of how controls support § 748.0 Security Program
      • Gap analysis for threat coverage

  rosi:
    description: |
      Return on Security Investment (ROSI) quantifies the financial value of 
      risk reduction achieved by a control relative to its cost.
    
    calculation: |
      ROSI = (Risk Reduction Value - Control Cost) / Control Cost
      
      Where:
      • Risk Reduction Value = Baseline EAL - Controlled EAL
      • Control Cost = Annual implementation and maintenance cost
      • EAL = Expected Annual Loss (from quantitative risk model)
    
    yaml_usage: |
      ROSI metrics support:
      • Remediation prioritization (P1 Scoring Calibration)
      • Board reporting and investment justification (P2 Board Reporting)
      • CFO and executive decision-making
      • Audit committee oversight of security spending effectiveness
    
    interpretation_guidance:
      - rosi_range: "> 100%"
        interpretation: Strong positive return – prioritize investment
        board_message: Control provides greater than 2:1 return on investment
      
      - rosi_range: "0% to 100%"
        interpretation: Positive return but moderate ROI
        board_message: Control is cost-justified based on risk reduction
      
      - rosi_range: "< 0%"
        interpretation: Negative return (cost exceeds risk reduction value)
        board_message: |
          Control may be justified for regulatory compliance (§ 748.0) but does 
          not provide quantifiable financial return. Consider cost optimization.

    design_effectiveness:
      score: 4
      assessment_basis: |
        Policy defines encryption requirements. Encryption standards documented. 
        Governance oversight in place. Minor gap: policy does not address 
        removable media encryption enforcement.
    
    operating_effectiveness:
      score: 3
      assessment_basis: |
        Combined multiplier of 0.50 indicates Partially Effective performance.
        • Frequency reduction (lam_mult = 1.0): No prevention of media loss events
        • Loss probability reduction (p_any_mult = 0.5): Strong – 50% reduction
        • Tail risk reduction (tail_mult = 0.25): Excellent – 75% reduction
        
        Conclusion: While encryption significantly reduces loss severity, the 
        control does not prevent media loss events. Score: 3 (Partially Effective).
    
    risk_rating: Medium
    
    finding_summary: |
      Media Encryption controls provide strong protection against data exfiltration 
      in the event of device loss or theft (50% reduction in loss probability, 
      75% reduction in worst-case severity). However, the control does not prevent 
      the underlying media loss events. Recommend enhancing with DLP and device 
      tracking controls to address frequency reduction.
  
  board_reporting_narrative: |
    Investment in Data Governance controls (Media Encryption - DG-06) demonstrates 
    exceptional return on security investment (500% ROSI) by materially reducing 
    the likelihood and severity of data exfiltration events. The control mitigates 
    Exfiltration and Impact tactics commonly used by threat actors and significantly 
    reduces modeled tail risk (VaR), supporting the institution's Security Program 
    effectiveness under 12 CFR § 748.0.
    
    While operating effectiveness is currently Partially Effective (score 3), the 
    strong financial return and tail risk reduction justify continued investment. 
    Recommend enhancement with Data Loss Prevention (DLP) capabilities to improve 
    frequency reduction and achieve Fully Effective status (score 5).

# GOVERNANCE REPORTING ALIGNMENT
# ============================================================================

governance_reporting_alignment:
  
  security_program_effectiveness_748_0:
    principle: |
      12 CFR § 748.0 requires federally insured credit unions to implement an 
      effective security program. Quantitative reductions in frequency, loss 
      probability, and severity demonstrate measurable program effectiveness.
    
    reporting_approach: |
      Operating Effectiveness scores translate technical performance into 
      governance-consumable metrics:
      • Score 5 (Fully Effective) = Strong evidence of § 748.0 compliance
      • Score 3 (Partially Effective) = Program gaps requiring remediation
      • Score 1 (Ineffective) = Material weakness potentially violating § 748.0
    
    board_dashboard_metrics:
      - metric: Percentage of controls scoring 4-5 (Effective)
        target: "> 80%"
        interpretation: Majority of controls operating effectively
      
      - metric: Average Operating Effectiveness score by domain
        target: "> 3.5"
        interpretation: Overall program effectiveness above Partially Effective
      
      - metric: High-risk controls (score 1-2) count
        target: "0"
        interpretation: No material weaknesses in critical controls
  
  incident_reporting_readiness_748_1:
    principle: |
      12 CFR § 748.1 requires credit unions to report cyber incidents within 
      72 hours. Controls reducing detection and response latency directly support 
      compliance with these obligations.
    
    critical_controls:
      - control_area: Monitoring and Detection (MON)
        multiplier_focus: lam_mult (frequency) and p_any_mult (detection)
        readiness_indicator: |
          Low lam_mult and p_any_mult indicate strong detection capability, 
          reducing time-to-discovery and supporting timely § 748.1 reporting.
      
      - control_area: Incident Response (IR)
        multiplier_focus: p_any_mult (containment) and tail_mult (impact)
        readiness_indicator: |
          Strong p_any_mult and tail_mult indicate effective containment and 
          impact reduction, reducing reporting complexity and board escalation time.
    
    reporting_metric: |
      Time-to-detect + Time-to-contain < 72 hours (§ 748.1 compliance threshold)
  
  board_decision_support:
    investment_prioritization:
      methodology: |
        Controls are prioritized using a combined score:
        Priority Score = (Operating Effectiveness Gap) × (ROSI) × (Risk Rating)
        
        Where:
        • Operating Effectiveness Gap = (5 - Current Score)
        • ROSI = Return on Security Investment (%)
        • Risk Rating = High (3), Medium (2), Low (1)
      
      interpretation: |
        Higher Priority Scores indicate investments with:
        • Large performance gaps
        • Strong financial returns
        • High risk reduction potential
    
    att&ck_coverage_reporting:
      purpose: |
        ATT&CK tactic mapping demonstrates breadth of threat coverage and 
        identifies gaps in adversary lifecycle mitigation.
      
      board_deliverable: |
        Heatmap showing control coverage across ATT&CK tactics (Initial Access, 
        Execution, Persistence, etc.) with gaps highlighted for investment 
        prioritization.
    
    regulatory_defensibility:
      approach: |
        Quantitative metrics (multipliers, ROSI) combined with qualitative 
        governance assessments (Design Effectiveness) provide examiners with:
        • Objective evidence of control performance
        • Financial justification for security investments
        • Traceability to CFR requirements
        • Repeatable, audit-defensible assessment methodology

      - Collect lam_mult, p_any_mult, tail_mult from quantitative risk engine
      - Calculate combined_mult = (lam × p_any × tail)^(1/3)
      - Map to Operating Effectiveness score using thresholds
    
    governance_assessments:
      - Assess Design Effectiveness via policy review, governance oversight
      - Score 1-5 based on maturity of documentation and governance structure
    
    evidence_linkage:
      - Reference VERIS fields in findings narratives
      - Map CIS Controls to YAML control_objective_link
      - Include ATT&CK tactics in board reporting for threat context
  
  scoring_workflow:
    step_1: Assess Design Effectiveness (governance maturity)
    step_2: Calculate Operating Effectiveness (from risk model multipliers)
    step_3: Determine overall control maturity = min(Design, Operating)
    step_4: Generate findings based on gaps in either dimension
    step_5: Prioritize remediation using ROSI and Priority Score
  
  automation_readiness:
    llm_integration: |
      LLM-driven assessments can now leverage quantitative metrics:
      • Automatically calculate combined_mult from risk model
      • Generate findings narratives incorporating VERIS and ATT&CK context
      • Produce board reports with ROSI and investment prioritization
      • Maintain deterministic scoring while enriching qualitative narratives
    
    api_integration: |
      Risk engine API provides:
      • GET /controls/{control_id}/multipliers → lam, p_any, tail
      • GET /controls/{control_id}/veris → mitigated VERIS fields
      • GET /controls/{control_id}/rosi → financial return metrics
      
      YAML framework consumes these inputs to score Operating Effectiveness.

# VALIDATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
# ============================================================================

validation:
  
  consistency_checks:
    - rule: Design Effectiveness = 5 AND Operating Effectiveness = 1
      interpretation: |
        Strong governance but ineffective execution. Policy exists but is not 
        operationalized. Common in post-implementation of new controls.
    
    - rule: Design Effectiveness = 1 AND Operating Effectiveness = 5
      interpretation: |
        Technically effective but lacks governance oversight. Risk of 
        inconsistency, documentation gaps, or inability to demonstrate 
        compliance to examiners.
    
    - rule: Combined_mult > 0.80 BUT Operating Effectiveness score > 2
      interpretation: |
        Score override detected. Investigate why technical performance does not 
        support assigned score. May indicate data quality issues or manual override.
  
  audit_trail:
    required_documentation:
      - Risk model version and calculation date
      - Control multiplier values (lam, p_any, tail) with source
      - YAML assessment date and assessor
      - Evidence supporting Design Effectiveness score
      - Findings narratives linking quantitative and qualitative dimensions
    
    traceability: |
      Full audit trail from risk model input → combined_mult → Operating 
      Effectiveness score → findings → board report ensures examiner defensibility 
      and supports § 748.0 compliance demonstration.
