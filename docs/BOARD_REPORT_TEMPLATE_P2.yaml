        interpretation: |
          VaR95 represents a severe but relatively frequent cyber event. 
          Controls should significantly reduce this exposure to protect 
          operational continuity.

          Reduction: [CALCULATE: ΔVaR99 / Net Worth]%
        
        interpretation: |
          VaR99 represents catastrophic tail-risk events (e.g., ransomware 
          with significant data exfiltration). Strong tail_mult controls are 
          critical for capital preservation and solvency protection.

      - Controlled scenario reflects current control portfolio
      - Risk reduction validated through P1 scoring calibration
  
  key_takeaway_narrative_template: |
    The selected controls reduced Expected Annual Loss (EAL) by ΔEAL = [INSERT], 
    producing a Return on Security Investment (ROSI) of [INSERT]. Critically, 
    the investment reduced 1-in-100 year tail exposure (VaR99) by ΔVaR99 = [INSERT], 
    strengthening resilience against catastrophic events and supporting the 
    effectiveness of the Security Program required by 12 CFR § 748.0.
  
  board_discussion_prompts:
    - |
      Is the current VaR99 exposure acceptable relative to net worth and 
      risk appetite?
    - |
      Does the ΔEAL justify continued investment in the control portfolio, 
      or should resources be reallocated?
    - |
      Are there high-impact, low-probability events (tail risks) that require 
      additional Board attention or insurance consideration?

        interpretation: |
          Controls with negative ROSI may be justified for regulatory compliance

  rosi_interpretation_guidance:
    methodology: |
      ROSI = (Risk Reduction Value - Control Cost) / Control Cost

        board_message: |
          Control provides positive return but moderate ROI. Review for 
          optimization opportunities.
      
      - rosi_range: "< 0.0"
        label: Negative Return (Cost > Benefit)
        board_message: |
          Control cost exceeds quantifiable risk reduction. May be justified 
          for regulatory compliance under 12 CFR § 748.0 but requires cost 
          review or performance improvement.
  
  prioritization_framework:
    methodology: |
      Priority Score = (Operating Effectiveness Gap) × (ROSI) × (Risk Rating Weight)
      
      Where:
      • Operating Effectiveness Gap = (5 - Current Operating Score)
      • ROSI = Return on Security Investment (decimal)
      • Risk Rating Weight: High = 3, Medium = 2, Low = 1
    
    interpretation: |
      Higher Priority Scores indicate investments with:
      • Large performance gaps (low Operating Effectiveness)
      • Strong financial returns (high ROSI)
      • High risk reduction potential
      
      Use to guide FY2026 remediation and enhancement budget allocation.

          Monitoring controls are critical for § 748.1 incident reporting readiness. 
          Strong p_any_mult demonstrates effective detection capability, reducing 
          time-to-discovery and supporting 72-hour reporting compliance.
  
  effectiveness_narrative_template: |
    Operating Effectiveness performance is driven by measured control multipliers:
    
    • Lower tail_mult values indicate strong severity (tail-risk) reduction
    • Lower lam_mult values indicate meaningful frequency reduction
    • Lower p_any_mult values indicate effective detection and containment
    
    Where Operating Effectiveness lags despite adequate Design Effectiveness, 
    management should prioritize:
    • Operating control improvements (execution, consistency)
    • Evidence production and documentation
    • Sustainment activities (training, monitoring, testing)
    
    This ensures continued § 748.0 Security Program effectiveness and readiness 
    for § 748.1 incident reporting obligations.
  
  maturity_interpretation:
    combined_maturity_approach: |
      Overall control maturity = MIN(Design Score, Operating Score)
      
      Rationale: A control cannot be fully effective if either governance or 
      technical execution is deficient.
    
    gap_patterns:
      - pattern: "Design = 5, Operating = 2"
        interpretation: |
          Strong governance but poor execution. Policy exists but is not 
          operationalized. Common post-implementation of new controls.
        remediation: Focus on technical implementation, training, and automation
      
      - pattern: "Design = 2, Operating = 5"
        interpretation: |
          Technically effective but lacks governance oversight. Risk of 
          inconsistency and inability to demonstrate compliance to examiners.
        remediation: Formalize policies, establish oversight, document procedures
      
      - pattern: "Design = 3, Operating = 3"
        interpretation: |
          Moderate maturity in both dimensions. Adequate but requires improvement 
          to achieve full § 748.0 effectiveness.
        remediation: Address both governance and technical gaps in parallel

      The separation between the Baseline and With Controls curves demonstrates 
      measurable reduction in tail risk exposure (VaR99) and supports risk-based 
      justification for security investment under 12 CFR § 748.0. The controlled 
      curve's lower position across all probability levels indicates comprehensive 
      program effectiveness.

report_conclusion:
  template: |
    Conclusion: The cybersecurity program demonstrates measurable risk reduction 
    and positive Return on Security Investment (ROSI), with the greatest governance 
    value reflected in tail-risk (VaR99) reduction. Maturity-based YAML scoring 
    confirms where controls are strong in both design and operation, and highlights 
    where operating performance must be improved to sustain Security Program 
    effectiveness under 12 CFR § 748.0 and maintain readiness to meet incident 
    reporting obligations under 12 CFR § 748.1.

  recommendations:
    - recommendation_id: R1
      priority: High
      action: |
        Prioritize remediation for controls with high Operating Effectiveness gaps 
        and strong ROSI potential using Priority Score framework.
